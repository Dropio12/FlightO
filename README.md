FlightO

-This algorithm is working well and we already upgraded it by adding multiple algorithms to upgrade it for our app. We are now trying to get fundraising with investor to make it big. I, also, plan on posting the API on FastApi for free for future prospect that will need it for projects. Since then, if you have questions, feel free to ask them to me here.


**OOOOLD**It is basically the upgrade from my previous attempt at creating a model that will give you the cheapest option to plan the flight itinerary of your next vacation. I still didn't find any free API that could get me the flights and price of them, so with a teacher at my university, we decided to create a bus itinerary app due to the fact that their API is free. This way we can simulate my code with a real database to see if it works. Thats what I did during this winter.
