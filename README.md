# FlightO

FlightO is an advanced algorithm designed to find the cheapest options for planning flight itineraries for your next vacation. We have continuously upgraded the algorithm, incorporating multiple enhancements to improve its efficiency and accuracy. Currently, we are seeking fundraising from investors to expand and scale the application further.

## Current Progress

- **Algorithm Enhancements**: The algorithm has been significantly improved by integrating multiple new algorithms.
- **Future API Release**: We plan to make the API available for free on FastAPI, allowing future developers and projects to benefit from it.

## Background

### Previous Iteration: OOOOLD

The initial version of this project aimed to create a model to provide the cheapest flight itineraries. However, due to the lack of free APIs for flight data, we pivoted to creating a bus itinerary app using a free API with the help of a university professor. This allowed us to test and simulate our code with a real database, ensuring its functionality. The initial work was conducted during the winter season.
